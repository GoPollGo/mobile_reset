# Mobile Reset
The mobile reset extends the concept of a CSS reset as popularized by [Eric Meyer's CSS Reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) to modern mobile devices. It eliminates additional inconsistencies and quirks, particularly on the iPhone.

## Usage
From the command line:

    (sudo) gem install mobile_reset

Or, add the following to your project's Gemfile:

    gem 'mobile_reset'

Simply import the stylesheet:

    @import 'mobile_reset';
